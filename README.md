The sale of agricultural products can be reformed in a number of ways. For example, policies could be put in place to encourage local producers and direct sales to consumers, or programs could be implemented to support farmers and help them access new markets. Additionally, certification systems could be established to ensure the quality of agricultural products and build consumer trust in these products. By taking these steps, the sale of agricultural products can be improved and the overall agriculture industry can be supported.
